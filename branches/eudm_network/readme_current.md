## Introduction

This is a readme to explain the madness you see in the file system before you. I have created life and so am a god. Anyway, this is a network that runs on a binary shifting-odds concept. Each bit (a 1 moving throught the network) is commanded by an array of *variable probability definitions*, defined by **numerical buckets**

## Branch

This branced network is designed to work with the ***Exponential Uncertainty Death Machine*** game, allowing the main character (the cat) to be controlled directly

## Status

the network kernel is run twice in an opencoarray format with two networks - the thinking part ant the motivation control part. The motivation part has not been written yet so the cat just moves around aimlessly. The intention is for the motivation network to take in a 'food' variable that represents a flow rate of mice caught and mice used. This is fed into the network, where the result feeds into a function that encourages actions that drives the cat to eat more mice

## Concepts and Examples

### Bucket

#### Selector

Random number: 0.28

#### Buckets

(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0)

#### Reality

As the **Random Number** falls between 0.2 and 0.3, it lies in the **Second Bucket**. This means that the data in this node of the network will feed in to the second route

### Routes

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - | - | - |
| 4 | x | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |

The table above shows the mapping for each node's routes. The x representes the node in question - the *home* node - and the numbered positions represent nodes adjacent to the home node. For instance, if route 1 is selected, the bit in the home node will move left one space and up one space in the network
